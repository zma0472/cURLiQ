  The cURLiQ System Standard Filesystem Structure
  ===============================================

  ${CURLIQ_HOME}/etc/cURLiQ  (1)
                 |   |
                 |   .UUID   (2)
                 |   |
                 |   .SYS    (3)
                 |   |
                 |   .BAK/   (4)
                 |
                 q/[queuename]/.UUID  (5)
                 |
                 bin/curliq  (6)
                 |
                 var/log/ops/CQOPS  (7)
                         |
                         sys/CQSYS  (8)


 (1) The etc/cURLiQ file contains the SQLite database which stores all the
     metadata, configuration settings, object definitions, and state
     information of the cURLiQ system which resides in ${CURLIQ_HOME}.

 (2) The etc/.UUID file must be present in order for the cURLiQ system resident
     in ${CURLIQ_HOME} to operate.  This file must contain the ASCII
     representation of the 128-bit UUID of the cURLiQ system which resides in
     ${CURLIQ_HOME}.  The representation is in the 8-4-4-4-12 format.  The file
     contains the 32 characters in the UUID plus the four dashes plus an ASCII
     newline character for a total of 37 characters.  The file is created as
     part of the cURLiQ instance installation and initialization.

 (3) The etc/.SYS file must be present in orser for the cURLiQ system resident
     in ${CURLIQ_HOME} to operate.  This file must contain the name of the
     resident cURLiQ system.

 (4) The etc/.BAK directory holds cURLiQ system snapshots in the form of copies
     of the etc/cURLiQ SQLite database file.

 (5) The etc/q directory contains zero or more directories each of which must
     have the same name as the queue which uses it as a source directory.  Each
     of these source directories must contain a .UUID file which contains the
     UUID of the queue.

 (6) The bin/curliq file is the executable cURLiQ system interface.  It is used
     to perform all administrative and operational functions of the cURLiQ
     system.

 (7) The var/log/ops/CQOPS file is the SQLite database file which contains
     time-stamped records of all operational actions performed by the cURLiQ
     system.

 (8) The var/log/sys/CQSYS file is the SQLite database file which contains
     time-stamped records of all administrative operations performed by the
     cURLiQ system.
